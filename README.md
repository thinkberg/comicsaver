# ComicSaver

View comic book PDFs on screen saver on MacOS X.

Why? Because the normal screen savers only accept normal images and don't allow 
PDF documents, unlike the the desktop background, where you can use a PDF instead
of a PNG or JPEG. And I wanted to have the art from my comic books showcased :-)
